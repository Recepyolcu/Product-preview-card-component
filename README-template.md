## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I learned using flex layout, center a div (lol), actually it's not perfectly done 'cause i think css could be better. And the :root selector.  

```css
:root{
    --design-color-primary-cream: hsl(30, 38%, 92%);
    --deging-color-primary-darkCyan: hsl(158, 36%, 37%);
    --design-color-neutral-veryDarkBlue: hsl(212, 21%, 14%);
    --design-color-neutral-darkGrayishBlue: hsl(228, 12%, 48%);
}
```

### Continued development

This product box model could be more responsive.
